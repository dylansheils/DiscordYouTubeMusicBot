# DiscordYouTubeMusicBot

   This takes a URL link to a YouTube video, downloads the file locally, streams it to the voice channel the issuer is in, and deletes the audio file afterwards.
I have implemented a queuing system which can support multiple different users across multiple different servers and a shuffling feature which allows users to shuffle
their future songs. One can also request to know their position in queue without issue. Use ?help to learn more about the specific commands the bot relies on. I hope this simple
and easy to understand implementation can be of some use to others.
